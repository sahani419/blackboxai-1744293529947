# Service App

## Project Overview
Service App is a simple web service built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. The application provides an endpoint that confirms the service is running. It's designed to be a basic example for developing web services using Flask, making it suitable for beginners who want to learn about web application development.

## Installation
To set up the Service App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Flask**:
   You can install Flask by running:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

## Usage
To run the Service App, execute the following command:
```bash
python service_app.py
```
By default, the application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/service`. You can test it by opening your browser or using a tool like curl or Postman.

### Example Request
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/service
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "message": "Service is running!"
}
```

## Features
- Simple API endpoint to check if the service is running.
- Built with Flask to demonstrate basic web service functionality.
- Responsive JSON output for easy integration with other applications.
